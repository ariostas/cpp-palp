# CPP-PALP: a C++ Package for Analyzing Lattice Polytopes

:warning:  **Important note** :warning: This project is in very early stages and currently offers no functionality. This message will be removed when it is at least partially working.

This project aims to rewrite [PALP](http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~kreuzer/CY/CYpalp.html) in C++, using modern conventions and build systems. PALP was originally written by Maximilian Kreuzer and Harald Skarke to study Calabi-Yau manifolds that can be constructed using toric geometry starting from a special kind of polytopes. Since its inception, it has provided unparalleled performance for many computations, has achieved incredible feats such as the construction of the famous [Kreuzer-Skarke database](http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~kreuzer/CY/), and is still being used in research and in other software packages such as [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) and [CYTools](https://cy.tools). Some limitations have emerged, leading Kreuzer to propose a renewed version written in C++ that he referred to as PALP++. He left an [unfinished project proposal](http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~www/palp++.pdf) with various goals and design considerations prior to his passing. In this project we hope to achieve some of these goals and give renewed impetus to PALP as an homage to its original authors.
